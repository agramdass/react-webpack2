# react-webpack2
This is a simple template project for building React apps. 

It's the template that I'm using for my projects that is using
the latest revisions of the different tooling and libraries available.

Note: Production flow still WIP since using beta libraries

Includes the following but not limited to:

- Webpack 2
- React hot loading
- await/async transpiling, class properties (ES7)
- code linting with eslint
- bundle code splitting
